                        <li>Light is treated as traveling in straight lines called rays.</li>
                        <li>Ray diagrams are used to represent the paths that light rays take as they interact with optical elements such as mirrors and lenses.</li>

                        <li>When a light ray encounters a smooth surface, such as a mirror, it reflects off the surface according to the law of reflection.</li>
                        <li>The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and both angles are measured with respect to the normal to the surface.</li>

                        <p>
                            Optical materials are substances that interact with light in various ways, influencing its propagation, absorption, reflection, refraction, and transmission. Here are some key points about optical materials:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Relativity encompasses two theories: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity deals with the relationship between space and time in the absence of gravity, while general relativity extends this to include the effects of gravity. These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity.
